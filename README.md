I started with brainstorming and chose the international student community as my targeted group, which I am part of. Inspired by my experiences and those of my peers, I aimed to create a survey that addresses the challenges faced by international students, offering resources and assistance. Then I briefly interviewed with my international friends and classmates to enrich the project's relevance, although I decided against including direct quotes in the end, which might be distracting for users to fill out the form.

After completing W3Schools tutorials, I'm more confident about my HTML skills. BUT My main challenges are with JavaScript, and few of CSS integration. Bunch of times that elements wouldn't display as intended. Also frequent typos and debugging difficulties freak me out often.

Given more time, I'd enrich the quiz's presentation, visual variation and interaction, and resolve existing technical issues for a smoother user experience.
